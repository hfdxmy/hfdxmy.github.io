PERSONAL INTEREST PROJECTS
======
1. **Simple model for Atmosphere**. TBD. *Concept*.
  * Dynamical core + Radiative transfer. Study atmosphere dynamics under various conditions.
  * Python for simulations.
1. **Evolution equation simulation, but random variables**. 2024/09. **Still updating**.
  * PDE simulation, but initial value is randomly given according to certain distribution, what is the evolution of the distribution?
  * First diffusion eq. (Linear), then Bergers equation or Lorenz models (Nonlinear).
  * Still searching for tools.
  * Currently start with ODE first.
1. **A calculator for a specific use**. 2024/04. *Mostly done, not continuing for now*.
  * Calculation by tag-matching from data. 
  * Vue.js for UI, JavaScript for core logic. YAML for storing data. 
1. **Fast-changing BV tests**. 2023/12. *Mostly done, not continuing for now*.
  * Simple models. If the fast-growing direction changes very fast, would BV able to catch up?
  * Matlab for simulation.
1. **Personal Website**. 2023/10. *Still updating*.
  * [Current website](https://vortexer99.github.io)
  * Jekyll and Github Pages for deployment, academicpages for template, Markdown for texts.
1. **A simulator for a specific use**. 2023/03. *Finish*.
  * Step forward in time to simulate state changes, event series and rules given.
  * wxPython for UI, Python for core logic. 
1. **LMD Mars PCM Simulation Controller**. 2022/11. *Still updating*.
  * To quickly initialize, submit and collect large amount of LMD Mars PCM experiments.
  Parameters can be easily assigned. Also perform required actions for BV & RP.
  * YAML for config settings, Shell and Python for actions.
1. **A calculator and a simulator for a specific use**. 2021/10. *Finish*.
  * Calculate from adjustable basic settings. Simulate from event series and rules given.
  * Excel for calculator, Mathematica for simulator.
1. **Personal Website**. 2018/04-2022/09. *Terminate*
  * 庄逸的数学和技术屋
  * Tencent Cloud (Student) for server，Wordpress for engine, with MySQL & PHP.
1. **My Math handbook**. 2016/11-2017/09. *Finish*.
  * “高中数学学习参考” or 《学霸带你玩转高中数学》
  * Word for formatting.
